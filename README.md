# PhotoShopKT
Image Manipulation application in Kotlin

PhotoShop-Style Image Editor in Kotlin
Developed a sophisticated command-line image processing application using Kotlin and Java Swing, demonstrating advanced object-oriented design principles and functional programming concepts. The application provides real-time image manipulation capabilities with an interactive graphical preview window.
Key Technical Achievements:

Implemented a robust color management system with bit manipulation for efficient RGB value handling, including color clamping and hexadecimal conversion utilities
Designed extensible transformation architecture using Kotlin interfaces and inheritance, supporting pixel-level operations (invert, grayscale) and complex multi-image operations
Built comprehensive blend mode system supporting transparency, multiply, and screen effects with mathematically accurate color combination algorithms
Developed kernel convolution engine for advanced filters including sharpen, blur, edge detection, and emboss effects using matrix operations
Created efficient windowing system for kernel operations with boundary handling for edge pixels

Core Features:

Real-time image preview with Swing UI integration
Command parser supporting multiple operations: load, save, crop, blend, and various filters
Image I/O handling with error management and user-friendly feedback
Modular architecture allowing easy extension of new transformations and blend modes
Memory-efficient image processing using BufferedImage manipulation

Technical Stack:
Kotlin, Java Swing, BufferedImage API, Object-Oriented Design Patterns (Strategy, Factory), Functional Programming
This project showcases proficiency in Kotlin language features including data classes, companion objects, operator overloading, and lambda expressions, while demonstrating strong software engineering practices through clean code organization and separation of concerns.
